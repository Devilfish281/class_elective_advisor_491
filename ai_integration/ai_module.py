"""ai_integration.ai_module
================================

Utilities and test hooks for the AI integration layer of the Smart Elective
Advisor. This module exposes a small public API for generating course
recommendations and includes CLI-driven self-tests used by ``main.py``.

**Contents**

* Environment helpers (e.g., :func:`parse_bool_env`)
* JSON/CSV I/O helpers for local “fake” responses
* Public recommendation entry point (:func:`get_recommendations_ai`)
* Test dispatcher (:func:`main_test_ai`)

.. rubric:: Sphinx integration

The docstrings in this module use reStructuredText **info field lists** (e.g.,
``:param:``, ``:returns:``, ``:raises:``), which Sphinx's Python domain renders
nicely with ``sphinx.ext.autodoc``. An ``autosummary`` is provided below for
clean API index pages.
