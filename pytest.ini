[pytest]
# Minimum pytest version required for this repo â€” prevents running with older incompatible pytest.
minversion = 7.0  # ensure pytest >= 7.0 is used (helps avoid subtle incompatibilities). 

# Default CLI options applied to every pytest invocation from this repo.
# - --strict-markers: fail on unknown/typoed @pytest.mark.X decorators (helps catch mis-typed markers).
#   If you enable strict markers, also declare your custom markers below via the `markers` option.
# - -q: quiet mode (limited console output); remove or use -v for verbose output in local debugging.
# - --cov=src: measure coverage for the `src` package (adjust path to your package directory if different).
# - --cov-report=term-missing: show coverage summary in terminal and list missing lines per file.
addopts = --strict-markers -q --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing  # default flags for all runs. 

# By default pytest will look here for tests when run from project root.
testpaths = tests  # keep tests in `tests/` directory to match this setting. 

# Pattern used to detect test files. Ex: test_example.py, test_foo.py
python_files = test_*.py  # explicit discovery pattern; change if your test filenames differ. 

# Optional: explicitly declare any custom markers used in your suite to make marker usage discoverable
# (useful combined with --strict-markers so typos error out rather than silently being ignored).
# Example:
# markers =
#     slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
#     gui: marks tests that touch GUI code and may require headless setup
#
# If you use many custom markers, uncomment and list them here.
